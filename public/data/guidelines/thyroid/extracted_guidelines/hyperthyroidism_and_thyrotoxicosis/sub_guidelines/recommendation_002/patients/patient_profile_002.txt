  "profile_summary": "John Doe is a 72-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease and hypertension who presents with symptomatic thyrotoxicosis. He exhibits palpitations, weight loss, increased sweating, tremors, and anxiety. His lab results indicate overt hyperthyroidism with significantly elevated free T4 and free T3 levels, and suppressed TSH. The thyroid ultrasound findings are consistent with Graves' disease. Given his advanced age and cardiovascular history, careful management including potential use of beta-adrenergic blockade is warranted."
