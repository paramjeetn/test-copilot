RECOMMENDATION 2
Beta-adrenergic blockade is recommended in all patients with symptomatic thyrotoxicosis, especially elderly pa- tients and thyrotoxic patients with resting heart rates in excess of 90 beats per minute or coexistent cardiovascular disease.
Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence.
In a randomized controlled trial of MMI alone versus MMI and a b-adrenergic blocking agent, after 4 weeks, patients taking b-adrenergic blockers had lower heart rates, less shortness of breath and fatigue, and improved ‘‘physical functioning’’ on the SF-36 health questionnaire (58).
Technical remarks: Since there is not sufficient b-1 se- lectivity of the available b-blockers at the recommended doses, these drugs are generally contraindicated in patients with bronchospastic asthma. In patients with quiescent bron- chospastic asthma in whom heart rate control is essential, or in patients with mild obstructive airway disease or symptomatic Raynaud’s phenomenon, a relative b-1 selective agent can be used cautiously, with careful monitoring of pulmonary status (Table 4). Occasionally, very high doses of b-blockers are required to manage symptoms of thyrotoxicosis and to reduce the heart rate to near the upper limit of normal (31), but most often low to moderate doses (Table 4) give sufficient symp- tom relief. Oral administration of calcium channel blockers, both verapamil and diltiazem, have been shown to affect rate control in patients who do not tolerate or are not candidates for b-adrenergic blocking agents.
