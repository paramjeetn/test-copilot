## Criteria for Beta-Adrenergic Blockade in Symptomatic Thyrotoxicosis:

**1. Key Clinical Parameters:**

* **Resting heart rate:** In excess of 90 beats per minute.

**2. Symptom Requirements:**

* **Presence of symptomatic thyrotoxicosis:**  This implies the patient is experiencing noticeable symptoms due to their hyperthyroidism.

**3. Risk Factors to Consider:**

* **Age:** Elderly patients.
* **Coexistent cardiovascular disease:**  This includes but is not limited to conditions like coronary artery disease, heart failure, or arrhythmias.

**4.  Relevant Comorbidities/Health Conditions to Consider:**

* **Bronchospastic asthma:** Beta-blockers are generally contraindicated. 
* **Quiescent bronchospastic asthma:** A relative β1-selective agent can be used cautiously with careful monitoring if heart rate control is essential.
* **Mild obstructive airway disease:** A relative β1-selective agent can be used cautiously with careful monitoring.
* **Symptomatic Raynaud’s phenomenon:** A relative β1-selective agent can be used cautiously with careful monitoring.

**5.  Patient-Specific Factors:**

* **Tolerance to beta-blockers:**  Alternative treatments like calcium channel blockers (verapamil or diltiazem) should be considered for patients who cannot tolerate beta-blockers.

**Important Notes:**

* This guideline specifically refers to the management of overt hyperthyroidism due to Graves' disease (GD).
* The guideline emphasizes symptom relief and heart rate control as key goals of treatment.
* The guideline acknowledges that high doses of beta-blockers may be necessary in some cases to achieve desired outcomes.
