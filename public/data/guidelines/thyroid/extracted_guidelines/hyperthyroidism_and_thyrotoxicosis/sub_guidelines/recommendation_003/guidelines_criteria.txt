## Criteria for Hyperthyroidism Management Recommendations:

**1. Beta-Adrenergic Receptor Blockade:**

* **Clinical Parameters/Conditions:**
    * Presence of thyrotoxicosis 
    * Severity of thyrotoxicosis (for Esmolol use in ICU setting)
* **Comorbidities/Health Conditions:**
    * Pregnancy (Propranolol preferred, Atenolol & Metoprolol avoided)
* **Patient-specific factors:**
    * Compliance (Atenolol may increase compliance)

**2. Treatment Modalities for Gravesâ€™ Hyperthyroidism:**

* **Clinical Parameters/Conditions:** 
    * Presence of Graves' Hyperthyroidism
    * Active vs. Inactive Graves' Ophthalmopathy (GO)
* **Comorbidities/Health Conditions:**
    * Pregnancy (RAI excluded, ATD & Surgery preferred)
    * Comorbidities with increased surgical risk and/or limited life expectancy (RAI & Surgery excluded, ATD preferred)
* **Patient-specific factors:** 
    *  Patient values and preferences regarding:
        * Definitive control of hyperthyroidism
        * Avoidance of surgery
        * Potential side effects of ATDs
        * Need for lifelong thyroid hormone replacement
        * Rapid resolution of hyperthyroidism
        * Potential worsening or development of GO
        * Possibility of remission
        * Avoidance of lifelong thyroid hormone treatment
        * Exposure to radioactivity

**3. Thyroid Receptor Antibodies (TRAb) Testing:**

* **Diagnostic Criteria:**
    * Differentiating between subacute and painless thyroiditis:
        * Subacute thyroiditis: Painful, firm/hard gland on palpation, erythrocyte sedimentation rate usually >50 mm/hr 
        * Painless thyroiditis: Often postpartum, personal/family history of autoimmune thyroid disease, measurable anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies
* **Patient-specific factors:**
    * Patients with GD preferring RAI treatment
